Repository for my Intro to CS Assignments

## Assignment-1: Kilim Rug Generator
Assignment to generate a symmetrical Kilim Rug Pattern using iteration. This assignment served as an introduction to iterative structures.

## Assignment-2: Single-Player Battleship
Assignment to create a basic single-player game of Battleship using multidimensional lists. Here one ship of user-selected size would be placed on a random line of squares either horizontally or vertically on a board of user-set dimensions. The user then takes turns guessing where the ship is. The game ends when the user hits all squares on the ship and the number of turns taken is displayed. This assignment covered concepts of multidimensional lists, functions, and iteration.

## Assignment-3: Multiplayer Word Search
Assignment to create a multiplayer word search game using file I/O structures. The user selects a difficulty level, each of which has 3 boards to pick from, one of which is randomly selected. The boards are CSV files that were provided by the Professor, converted to objects of a Board class. N players (set at the start of the game) then take turns searching for words on the board, which got added to their score. The game ends when all words are found and player with highest score wins. This assignment covered concepts of file I/O, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), functions, and memory structures (lists/dictionaries).
